An “action-based object” Paradigm or Action-Object based Programming (AOP) in programming could refer to a programming paradigm where objects are defined with their actions, or methods, rather than their data.

In this paradigm, the focus is on what an object can do, rather than what data it contains. This is in contrast to traditional object-oriented programming (OOP), where objects are defined by their data and the methods that operate on that data.

In an action-based object paradigm, objects would be designed around the actions they can perform. For example, while defining a Car object with properties such as make, model, and year, you can then define it with methods such as drive(), park(), and refuel().

This approach could have several benefits. By focusing on the actions an object can perform, it may be easier to design more modular and reusable code. It could also make it easier to reason about the behavior of a system, as the interactions between objects would be defined by the actions they can perform, rather than the data they share.

Think about it as an API Based Class Language.
