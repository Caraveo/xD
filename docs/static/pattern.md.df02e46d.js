The model represents the data and the business logic of the application, the view is responsible for displaying the data to the user, and the controller handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.</p><p>This means that the data processing is handled in a more modular and reusable way, with a clear separation of concerns between the interface, data, and controller components.</p><p>This module will provide an API library for the controller to interact with, allowing for a clean separation between the data processing and the controller logic. The controller would then be responsible for coordinating interactions between the interface and the data processing module.</p><p>The interface component would focus on providing a smooth and intuitive user experience. This could involve using modern UI design principles and techniques to create an engaging and easy-to-use interface. The interface would communicate with the controller to handle user input and update the view accordingly.</p><p>Overall, this “INTERFACE-DATA-CONTROLLER” pattern could provide a creative and effective way to design software applications, by building on the strengths of the MVC pattern while adding additional layers of abstraction and focus on user experience.</p><p>The Design Pattern is heavily focused on creating simple code + beautiful apps.</p>',10),s=[o];function c(d,l,p,h,u,g){return t(),a("div",null,s)}const _=e(i,[["render",c]]);export{m as __pageData,_ as default};
